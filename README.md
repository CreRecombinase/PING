# PING2

Use with the PING2_run.R script.
The run script is meant to be run from top to bottom every time (previous alignments should be skipped).

Change line 2 to wherever you download PING2 -> setwd('/home/LAB_PROJECTS/PING2_PAPER/PING2')

Change lines 9-13 to fit your data/environment

Seeing the following message in the copy graphing module is normal:

'A line object has been specified, but lines is not in the mode
Adding lines to the mode...'
